Word Analytic website is a sleek and functional tool designed to help users monitor and analyze their text inputs in real-time. With a modern and intuitive interface, it allows users to easily track the number of characters and words they type into a provided text area. The website displays live statistics, including the total word count, character count, and the number of remaining characters allowed for platforms like Twitter (280 characters) and Facebook (2200 characters).

It will removed from my github repo. Please be sure to follow my [codepen](https://codepen.io/dertzey).
